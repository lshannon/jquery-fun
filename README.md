# JQuery Fun

This is a repo with some JQuery examples to help me understand how JQuery can do the following:

- Bind with backing data (ie: HTTP calls to get JSON)
- Update the UI of an application

I'm also curious to learn about the basic syntax.

What spawned this is I orginially wanted to use AngularJS, however a conflict with JQuery plugins has derailed that.

Here is where I did a similar experiment with AngularJS:

Here is a thread where I pose the best way to work around/work with JQuery plugins:

My gut feel is JQuery is the way to go. Lets see what we can learn.

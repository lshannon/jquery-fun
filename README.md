# JQuery Fun

This is a repo with some JQuery examples to help me understand how JQuery can do the following:

- Bind with backing data (ie: HTTP calls to get JSON)
- Update the UI of an application

I'm also curious to learn about the basic syntax.

What spawned this is I originally wanted to use AngularJS, however a conflict with JQuery plugins has derailed that.

Here is where I did a similar experiment with AngularJS:

Here is a thread where I pose the best way to work around/work with JQuery plugins:

My gut feel is JQuery is the way to go. Lets see what we can learn.

NOTES:
-----

- JQuery versions can be found here: http://jquery.com/download/. At the time of doing this, JQuery was at:
https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.slim.min.js

- Hosted version from Google: <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

- Hosted version from MSN: <script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.12.4.min.js"></script>

- WebStorm is the IDE I used to work on this, its pretty sweet
